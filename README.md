## OVERVIEW

To begin with, the database contains three tables: 'departments,' 'employees,' and 'projects.' The 'departments' table contains information about different departments, including the department's ID, name, and manager's ID. The 'employees' table stores data on individual employees, such as their ID, name, hire date, job title, and the department they belong to. Lastly, the 'projects' table holds details about various projects, including the project's ID, name, start date, end date, and the department associated with it.

## CASE STUDY QUESTIONS
